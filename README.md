That is my first React project! 
The concept of this project is based on a T-shirt I have. on the back of the T-shirt printed an italian resturant menu,and that gave me the idea to make an ecommerce platform, that sales the meals from the shirt.
In this project i'm fetching data from a firebase DB, loading the meals and clients' orders, and sending users orders to the server.
There are 2 options for service methods: delivery to costumer's house or a pickup using exact date and pickup time.
Technologies used: api- firebase, async functions. UI- MUI, AwsomeIcons. React-JS,HTML,CSS.
